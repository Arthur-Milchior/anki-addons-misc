# Miscellaneous Anki Add-ons

This repository contains most of the smaller Anki add-ons I have written over the years. For more information on each add-on please take a look at the comments in the respective source file, or at its [AnkiWeb description](docs/descriptions.md).

## Naming Scheme

The source file naming describes which part of Anki each add-on interacts with. As such, the names do not always correspond with their listings on AnkiWeb. 

Add-on file names also have an impact on their loading order. Files with a leading special character are designed to be imported after most other add-ons have been loaded, as they might interact with them.

## Credits

Some of the add-ons found in this repository were either adopted from earlier works by other authors or simply constitute re-uploads of add-ons that disappeared from AnkiWeb, with no original code repository to be found. I have tried to document the development history of each of these add-ons in their source code header, but more detailed information may also be found [here](docs/credits.md).

## License

Most of the add-ons in this repository are licensed under the same license as Anki, the [GNU AGPL, version 3 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html). Please check the source code comments for more details on the licensing of each add-on.
