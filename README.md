# Misc Anki Add-ons

This repository contains a number of smaller add-ons I've written for Anki over the years. For more information on each add-on please take a look at the comments in the respective source file

## Overview of the add-ons

- **anki-add-reverse-toggle**: adds a user-defined key-binding that toggles the 'reverse' field in optionally reversible note types (default: Alt+Shift+B); this one is locale-dependent, so make sure to edit the source file with the name of the 'reverse' field in your note models
- **anki-browser-lookup**: adds a context-menu entry to search the card browser for selected words.
- **anki-browser-suspend-hotkey**: adds a suspend hotkey to the card browser (default: Ctrl+J)
