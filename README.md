# Misc Anki Add-ons

This repository contains a number of smaller add-ons I've written for Anki over time. For more information on each add-on please take a look at the comments in the respective source file. Some of these add-ons have been published on AnkiWeb. Check out [ankiweb.md](/ankiweb.md) for their descriptions.

## Naming scheme

The source file naming describes which part of Anki each add-on interacts with. As such, the names don't always correspond to how the add-ons are listed on AnkiWeb. 

Anki loads add-on modules alphabetically. Add-ons with a leading underscore are designed to be imported after most other add-ons have been loaded as they might interact with them.

## License

Most of the add-ons in this repository are licensed under the same license as Anki, the [GNU GPL, version 3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Please check the comments in the header for more details on the licensing of each add-on.
