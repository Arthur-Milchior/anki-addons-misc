# Miscellaneous Anki Add-ons

This repository contains most of the add-ons I've written for Anki over the years. For more information on each add-on please take a look at the comments in the respective source file. Most of the add-ons I've published on AnkiWeb are documented in the [ankiweb.md document](/ankiweb.md).

Make sure to also check out my other Anki-related projects:

- [Image Occlusion Enhanced](https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced)
- [Anki Remote](https://github.com/Glutanimate/unified-remote-anki)
- [My fork](https://github.com/Glutanimate/anki-addons-misc1) of [steveaw/anki_addons](https://github.com/steveaw/anki_addons)

## Naming scheme

The source file naming describes which part of Anki each add-on interacts with. As such, the names don't always correspond to how the add-ons are listed on AnkiWeb. 

Anki loads add-on modules alphabetically. Add-ons with a leading special character are designed to be imported after most other add-ons have been loaded as they might interact with them.

## License

Most of the add-ons in this repository are licensed under the same license as Anki, the [GNU GPL, version 3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Please check the comments in the header for more details on the licensing of each add-on.
