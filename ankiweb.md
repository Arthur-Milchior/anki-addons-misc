### anki-browser-search-hotkeys.py

**Browser search hotkeys**

**Allows you to set up hotkeys for searches in the browser**

Hotkeys follow this scheme: Ctrl+S –> (Modifier) + Key. I.e.: hit Ctrl+S to start the key sequence, let go of Ctrl+S, then hit the key assigned to  your search, plus an optional modifier.

You can use keyboard modifiers to control whether to add a term to the  search, negate it, remove it, or do something else. This follows the same  logic as the default behaviour in Anki when clicking on a search term in the sidebar.

New hotkeys can be defined in the source file by editing the `search_shortcuts` dictionary. Make sure to follow the existing syntax.

For instance, line 2 in the default `search_shortcuts` dict assigns the search
'added 1' (cards added today) to 'T'. This defines the following key sequences
in the browser:

    Ctrl+S -> T             replace search field with 'added:1'
    Ctrl+S -> Ctrl+T        add 'added:1' to existing search
    Ctrl+S -> Alt+T:        replace search field with '-added:1'
    Ctrl+S -> Ctrl+Alt+T:   add '-added:1' to existing search
    Ctrl+S -> Shift+T:      add 'or added:1' to existing search

The following keys are assigned by default:

    'A': ''
    'C': 'deck:current'
    'N': 'is:new'
    'R': 'is:review'
    'D': 'is:due'
    'M': 'tag:marked'

### anki-browser-search-modifiers.py

**Browser search modifiers**

**Checkbox toggles that modify how the browser search behaves**

Adds two checkboxes to the browser search form that, when toggled, modify searches in the following way:

**Deck** (Hotkey: Alt+D): Limit results to current deck
**Card** (Hotkey: Alt+C): Limit results to first card of each note

![screenshot](screenshots/anki-browser-search-modifiers.png)

Based on the following add-ons:

- "Limit searches to current deck" by Damien Elmes
   (https://github.com/dae/ankiplugins/blob/master/searchdeck.py)
- "Ignore accents in browser search" by Houssam Salem
   (https://github.com/hssm/anki-addons)

Original idea by Keven on the [Anki support forums](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop/17918-add-on-or-anki-feature-suggestion-show-only-front-card-in-browser-checkbox).

Special thanks to ankitest for testing and improving this add-on.

### anki-browser-create-duplicate.py

**Create Duplicate Notes**

**Overview**

This add-on supplements the card browser by adding a keyboard shortcut and menu entry for creating duplicates of notes.

Pressing the shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+C by default) or clicking on the 'Create Duplicate' entry in the Edit menu will find all notes belonging to the selected cards and duplicate them in place.

**A few pointers**

- All cards generated by each note will be duplicated alongside the note
- All duplicated cards will end up in the deck of the first selected card
- The duplicated cards should look exactly like the originals
- Tags are preserved in the duplicated notes
- Review history is NOT duplicated to the new cards (they appear as new cards)
- The notes will be marked as duplicates (because they are!)

### anki-browser-lookup.py

**Search browser for selected words**

A simple Anki add-on that adds a context-menu entry to search the card browser for selected words.

**Changes**

2016-04-19 - double-quote phrases when searching

### anki-editor-field-navigation.py

**Quick Field Navigation Add-on for Anki**

**Quickly navigate through your entry fields in the card editor**

This add-on provides the following shortcuts:

**Ctrl** + **1-9**: Switch focus to field 1-9
**Ctrl** + **0**: Switch focus to last field
**Alt** + **Shift** + **F**: Switch focus back to note fields from tag field (to complement Anki's inbuilt Ctrl + Shift + T) hotkey to switch to the tags field)

Note: In their current implementation the hotkeys will not work when the tag suggestions drop-down box is active. I am [still looking for a fix for this](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/4725-dd-on-development-unable-to-switch-editor-focus-back-to-web-view-when-tags-completer-is-active).

**Changelog**

2016-04-19 – Reworked the add-on from scratch to have a much leaner footprint
2015-09-04 – Initial release

-------------------------------

## Yet to be published

- **anki-add-reverse-toggle**: adds a user-defined key-binding that toggles the 'reverse' field in optionally reversible note types (default: Alt+Shift+B)
 
    This one is locale-dependent, so make sure to edit the source file with the name of the 'reverse' field in your note models

- **anki-browser-more-hotkeys**: adds two additional hotkeys to the card browser, CTRL+R for rescheduling cards and CTRL+ALT+I for inverting the selection.

- **anki-reviewer-hint-hotkeys**: based on [Hint-peeking Keyboard Bindings](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2616209911) by Ben Lickly. Adds two hotkeys to the reviewer: 'H' to reveal hints one by one, 'G' to reveal all hints at once.

- **anki-card-stats**: based on [Card Info During Review](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2179254157) by Damien Elmes and [reviewer_show_cardinfo](https://github.com/steveaw/anki_addons/blob/master/reviewer_show_cardinfo.py) by Steve AM. Extends Damien's add-on with the review log table that can also be found in the Browser.

- **anki-sibling-spacing-whitelist**: based on [Sibling Spacing](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2951410923) by Andreas Klauer. Modified to follow a whitelist approach when choosing which note types to enable on. Check the comments in the source file for more information.

If an add-on doesn't appear in this document there's a very good chance it's not ready for general use, yet.
