### anki-browser-search-hotkeys.py

**Browser search hotkeys**

**Allows you to set up hotkeys for searches in the browser**

Hotkeys follow this scheme: Ctrl+S –> (Modifier) + Key. I.e.: hit Ctrl+S to start the key sequence, let go of Ctrl+S, then hit the key assigned to  your search, plus an optional modifier.

You can use keyboard modifiers to control whether to add a term to the  search, negate it, remove it, or do something else. This follows the same  logic as the default behaviour in Anki when clicking on a search term in the sidebar.

New hotkeys can be defined in the source file by editing the `search_shortcuts` dictionary. Make sure to follow the existing syntax.

For instance, line 2 in the default `search_shortcuts` dict assigns the search
'added 1' (cards added today) to 'T'. This defines the following key sequences
in the browser:

    Ctrl+S -> T             replace search field with 'added:1'
    Ctrl+S -> Ctrl+T        add 'added:1' to existing search
    Ctrl+S -> Alt+T:        replace search field with '-added:1'
    Ctrl+S -> Ctrl+Alt+T:   add '-added:1' to existing search
    Ctrl+S -> Shift+T:      add 'or added:1' to existing search

The following keys are assigned by default:

    'A': {'search': ''},            # All together now
    'T': {'search': 'added:1'},     # Today
    'V': {'search': 'rated:1'},     # Viewed
    'G': {'search': 'rated:1:1'},   # aGain today
    'F': {'search': 'card:1'},      # First
    'C': {'search': 'deck:current'},# Current
    'N': {'search': 'is:new'},      # New
    'L': {'search': 'is:learn'},    # Learn
    'R': {'search': 'is:review'},   # Review
    'D': {'search': 'is:due'},      # Due
    'S': {'search': 'is:suspended'},# Suspended
    'B': {'search': 'is:buried'},   # Buried
    'M': {'search': 'tag:marked'},  # Marked
    'E': {'search': 'tag:leech'},   # lEech

**Changes**

### anki-browser-search-modifiers.py

**Browser search modifiers**

**Checkbox toggles that modify how the browser search behaves**

Adds two checkboxes to the browser search form that, when toggled, modify searches in the following way:

**Deck** (Hotkey: Alt+D): Limit results to current deck
**Card** (Hotkey: Alt+C): Limit results to first card of each note

![screenshot](screenshots/anki-browser-search-modifiers.png)

Based on the following add-ons:

- "Limit searches to current deck" by Damien Elmes
   (https://github.com/dae/ankiplugins/blob/master/searchdeck.py)
- "Ignore accents in browser search" by Houssam Salem
   (https://github.com/hssm/anki-addons)

Original idea by Keven on the [Anki support forums](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop/17918-add-on-or-anki-feature-suggestion-show-only-front-card-in-browser-checkbox).

Special thanks to ankitest for testing and improving this add-on.

### anki-browser-create-duplicate.py

**Duplicate selected Notes**

**Overview**

This add-on supplements the card browser by adding a keyboard shortcut and menu entry for creating duplicates of notes.

Pressing the shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+C by default) or clicking on the 'Create Duplicate' entry in the Edit menu will find all notes belonging to the selected cards and duplicate them in place.

**A few pointers**

- **Important**: All cards generated by each note will be duplicated alongside the note
- All duplicated cards will end up in the deck of the first selected card
- The duplicated cards should look exactly like the originals
- Tags are preserved in the duplicated notes
- Review history is NOT duplicated to the new cards (they appear as new cards)
- The notes will be marked as duplicates (because they are!)

**Changes**

2016-04-30 - duplications can now be undone via CTRL+Z (using Anki's default restoration points)

### anki-editor-field-navigation.py

**Quick Field Navigation Add-on for Anki**

**Quickly navigate through your entry fields in the card editor**

This add-on provides the following shortcuts:

**Ctrl** + **1-9**: Switch focus to field 1-9
**Ctrl** + **0**: Switch focus to last field
**Alt** + **Shift** + **F**: Switch focus back to note fields from tag field (to complement Anki's inbuilt Ctrl + Shift + T) hotkey to switch to the tags field)

Note: In their current implementation the hotkeys will not work when the tag suggestions drop-down box is active. I am [still looking for a fix for this](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/4725-dd-on-development-unable-to-switch-editor-focus-back-to-web-view-when-tags-completer-is-active).

**Changelog**

2016-04-19 – Reworked the add-on from scratch to have a much leaner footprint
2015-09-04 – Initial release

### anki-editor-tag-hotkeys.py

**Editor Tag Hotkeys Add-on for Anki**

This is a very simple add-on for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) that adds a few hotkey toggles for user-defined tags. It also includes a hotkey that clears the tags field (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> by default)

**Usage**

*Adding a tag hotkey*

Edit `anki-editor-tag.hotkeys.py` and modify the `onSetupButtons` function with your custom hotkeys and tags. For instance, to add a toggle for the tag *important* and assign it to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> you would replace the following block:

```python
s = QShortcut(QKeySequence(Qt.CTRL + Qt.SHIFT + Qt.Key_1), editor.parentWindow)
s.connect(s, SIGNAL("activated()"),
          lambda : toggleTag(editor, "toggled-tag1"))
```

with:

```python
s = QShortcut(QKeySequence(Qt.CTRL + Qt.SHIFT + Qt.Key_I), editor.parentWindow)
s.connect(s, SIGNAL("activated()"),
          lambda : toggleTag(editor, "important"))
```

You can add as many toggles as you want by placing additional blocks of this type under the `def onSetupButtons(editor):` line. Make sure to preserve the indenting!

For a list of all possible key assignments check here:

- [keys](http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/centos0/ics-custom-build/BUILD/PyQt-x11-gpl-4.7.2/doc/html/qt.html#Key-enum)
- [modifiers](http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/centos0/ics-custom-build/BUILD/PyQt-x11-gpl-4.7.2/doc/html/qt.html#Modifier-enum)

*Defining a unique tag*

Sometimes you might want to quickly toggle between several different tags. For this purpose I've implemented a configuration option called uniqueTags. Any items added to this list will cause their respective hotkeys to delete all other instances of unique tags aside from the one currently being triggered. 

For instance, if you set up hotkeys for "subject-a" and "subject-b" and add these tags to `uniqueTags`, hitting the hotkey for "subject-a" will delete "subject-b" from the tags list and vice-versa.

To add a unique tag, simply update the following excerpt in the script:

```python
uniqueTags = [
    "subject-a", "subject-b"
]
```

Please make sure to preserve the formatting and quoting while doing so!

### anki-editor-autocomplete-whitelist.py

**Overview**

This is a modified version of the [Editor Autocomplete add-on for Anki](https://github.com/sartak/anki-editor-autocomplete). Instead of checking against a blacklist of non-autocompleted fields this implementation of the add-on will only enable autocomplete on fields you specify.

Fields to enable autocomplete on can be specified by modifying the `AutocompleteFields` array at the beginning of the script, e.g.:

```python
AutocompleteFields = [ "sources", "additional-info" ]
```

This version of the add-on also includes a hotkey that saves you the trouble of clicking on the autocomplete suggestion. It's set to <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> by default.

All credit for the original add-on goes to Shawn M Moore ([@sartak](https://github.com/sartak/)).


### anki-editor-restore-fields.py

**Editor Field History**

**Overview**

This add-on enhances Anki's note editor with the following:

- hotkeys that copy over tags and field values of the last note in the same deck
- a history window that provides a list of last used values for the current field

Overview of all available hotkeys:

*Ctrl + Alt + H* – Invoke history window
*Alt+Z* – Copy over current field from last note
*Alt+Shift+Z* – Copy over a a number of user-defined fields (see below)
*Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Z* – Copy over all fields

**Configuration**

You can edit the add-on's source code to modify the following:

`history_window_shortcut`: controls the hotkey for invoking the history window
`field_restore_shortcut`: controls "Restore current field hotkey"
`partial_restore_shortcut`: controls "Restore a number of user-defined fields" hotkey
`full_restore_shortcut`: controls "Restore all fields" hotkey
`partial_restore_fields`: list of fields that are restored by the `partial_restore_shortcut`. Needs to be formatted as a python list (e.g. `["field1", "field2", "field3"]`).

**Changelog**

2016-06-04 – Added history window to the add-on (invoked via Ctrl+Alt+H)

## The rest

If an add-on doesn't appear in this document there's a very good chance it's not ready for general use, yet.
